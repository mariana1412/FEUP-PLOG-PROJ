## [Greener](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/226081/greener)

### Description

**Greener** is one of the three games of the **GreenGreenerGreenest** set. It is a capturing game for 2 players, where both aim to capture the same color, green.
Depending on the set, there should be:

* Basic: a 6×6 board, 15 black pyramids, 20 green pyramids, 15 white pyramids.
* Advanced: a 6×9 – 9×9 board (using one or both pads), 30 black pyramids, 45 green pyramids, 30 white pyramids.

### Setup  

First of all, it is necessary to calculate the **number of pieces** of each color: the number of black and white pyramids must be between a quarter and a third of the board cells and there must be _at least_ as many green pyramids as black/white pieces.  For example, it is recommended to use 9 black, 9 white and 18 green pieces on a 6×6 board.

Secondly, each player will have an allocated color (**black** or **white**) and will alternately place **one piece at a time** on the board. The remaining cells will be filled with **green** pyramids.

### How to play

Usually **black** starts. Players **alternate** turns during the game, moving zero or one piece at a time **orthogonally** (vertically or horizontally). They **must** capture one pyramid or stack of **any** color if possible; otherwise, they have to **pass** the turn. 	

The **game ends** when all players pass in succession. The player with the **most green pyramids** captured (being part of stacks they control) wins the game. In case of a **tie**, the player with the **highest stack** wins. If the tie persists, **play again**.
